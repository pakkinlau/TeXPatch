TeXPatch — Patch TeX quirks in Markdown

Overview
TeXPatch fixes small TeX quirks in LLM‑generated Markdown so math renders cleanly in KaTeX/MathJax. It converts only the snippet you select — no full‑document rewrites, no network calls.

How it works
- Select any text on a page
- Open the TeXPatch popup
- Click “Convert selection → clipboard”
- Optional: enable “Replace in editable” to replace text inside inputs/textareas/contentEditable

Profiles
- katex (default), pandoc, github — choose in the popup; preference is saved.

Privacy
- 100% local. The extension reads your current selection only when you click its button. No analytics. No network requests. Your profile preference is stored in chrome.storage.sync.

Permissions
- activeTab: act on the current tab when you click the button
- scripting: run short, page‑scoped functions to read/replace selection
- storage: save your profile preference
- clipboardWrite: reliably copy converted text to the clipboard

Why TeXPatch
- Idempotent and deterministic transforms
- Avoids code fences/inline code/links
- Works with KaTeX/MathJax conventions
